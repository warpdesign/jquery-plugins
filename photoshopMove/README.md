jquery.photoshopdMove.js
========================

This is a simple plugin that allows to move inside a div much like you can do it in Photoshop (tm)
with the space + lmb shortcut.

This is untested on anything other than Chrome 22 and have only been developed for my own needs
so there are not that much options available.

Usage
-----

Example:

 $('myDiv').photoshopMove(options);

 available options:

  startCB:           function to execute when drag has started
  endCB:             function to execute when drag has ended
